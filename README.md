# Classification and Clustering
This is my submission for the Lab assignment 3 in Data mining class. The repository includes 2 algorithms: Binary classification using Decision Tree (ID3) and K-means clustering.

## Decision Tree algorithm (ID3)
- Read data and split the data into training set and test set
- Implement a Decision Tree architecture with 2 main methods: fit and visualize. No external libraries are allowed

## K-means clustering
- The dataset contains 1500 data points in a 2d space that belongs to 3 clusters
- Implement the K-means clustering algorithm utilizing numpy
